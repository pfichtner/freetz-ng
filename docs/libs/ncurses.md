 - Library: [master/make/libs/ncurses/](https://github.com/Freetz-NG/freetz-ng/tree/master/make/libs/ncurses/)

ncurses is a programming library providing an API, allowing the programmer to write text user interfaces in a terminal-independent manner. It also optimizes screen changes, in order to reduce the latency experienced when using remote shells. Ncurses stands for "new curses", and is a replacement for the discontinued 4.4 BSD classic curses.
